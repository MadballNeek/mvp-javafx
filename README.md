mvp-javafx
==========

A simple concurrent JavaFX program demonstrating the MVP, IoC &amp; Command patterns. This can be used to bootstrap a
JavaFX program.

This program was developed to not only act as a bootstrap project, but to educate my fellow team members on these patterns
when creating GUI software, as well as to expose them to the Google Guice &amp; Guava libraries. Now,
I'm sharing it with the rest of the world too!
